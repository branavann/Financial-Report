# Financial-Report
In this project, I simulated the responsibilities of a data visualization developer at Yahoo Finance by visualizing stock information pertaining to Netflix. In finance, a stock profile is a series of studies, visualizations, and analyses that dive into different aspects a publicly traded company's data.  For the purposes of the project, I will only visualize data for the year of 2017. Specifically, I will create the following visualizations:  

* The distribution of the stock prices for the past year Netflix's earnings and revenue in the last four quarters 
* The actual vs. estimated earnings per share for the four quarters in 2017 
* A comparison of the Netflix Stock price vs the Dow Jones Industrial Average price in 2017
